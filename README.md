## Task 3: Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM)

OEM access was not successful (the OEM port did not open), so the dashboard could not display the Oracle environment and PDB information.

Screenshot included.

---

## Challenges

Minor Oracle errors were encountered (wrong container and existing user), but they were resolved successfully.
OEM port access did not work (attempted port 5500 but it did not open).
