OEM access was not successful (the OEM port did not open), so the dashboard could not display the Oracle environment and PDB information.

Minor Oracle errors were encountered (wrong container and existing user), but they were resolved successfully.
OEM port access did not work (attempted port 5500 but it did not open).
